                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Kristin Hawkins was raised in the small town of Lewisburg, in western Ohio. Kristin is currently pursuing her Bachelor’s Degree with a major of Elementary Education. Kristin is currently a licensed cosmetologist and hair stylist, but wants to finish her bachelor’s degree and begin teaching in her own classroom. Kristin enjoys Pop music above all other genres, specifically Taylor Swift. Kristin considers some of her greatest accomplishments to be earning her cosmetology license from the state, being in a relationship with the same person for over 10 years, and buying a house with her husband at the age of 22. </p>

                <p>The most important thing in Kristin’s life is her family. She wants her family and her friends to remember her through the good times and the happiness, and not dwell on the hard times or carry grudges.</p>

                <p>In 10 years, Kristin hopes to be teaching in her own Classroom. She also hopes to have two children. Finally, she hopes that she will be completely debt free after that amount of time.</p>
